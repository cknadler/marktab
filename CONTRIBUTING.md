# Contributing

MarkTab is currently under development. There are two main ways to contribute:

## Browse the source

Searching the source for `TODO` tags is a simple way to find broken, unimplemented, or poorly implemented chunks of MarkTab.

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
grep -rn "TODO" src
```

## Browse the issues

MarkTab uses GitHub issues. Check them out [here](https://github.com/cknadler/marktab/issues?sort=updated&state=open). They are kept up to date with the state of the current implementation.

## Doing work

If you are planning on tackling a `TODO` tag or an issue, let me know in one way or another. For `TODO` tags, open up an issue or send me an email. For issues that are already open, just leave a comment or send me an email.

## Thanks

If you made it this far, thanks for even considering contributing to MarkTab. Seriously, you are awesome.
