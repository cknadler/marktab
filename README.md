And then, to run all tests:

```

## Docs

The [MarkTab grammar](https://github.com/cknadler/marktab/blob/master/docs/grammar.md) is fairly solid at this point. Until the first implementation is finished, this is the only real source of documentation for the language. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue.
